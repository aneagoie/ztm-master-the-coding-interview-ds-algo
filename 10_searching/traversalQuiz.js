// //If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
// BFS

// //If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: 
// BFS - DFS will be slower

// //If the tree is very wide:
// DFS - BFS will need too much memory, in a queue

// //If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
// DFS

// //Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
// DFS

// //Finding the shortest path:
// BFS
